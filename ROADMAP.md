Here's a structured roadmap for the development of the time tracking website app you can present to AI tools. This roadmap will break down the development stages, starting from the foundational steps to the features, and covering the specific requirements you've mentioned.

1. Planning Phase
Objectives:
Define clear project scope and requirements
Set up a timeline for milestones
Tasks:

Establish the overall user experience (UX) flow.
Identify tech stack for frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (serverless, static hosting via GitHub Pages).
Determine database solution (e.g., Firebase, AWS Lambda, or serverless backend using JSON storage).
Design wireframes for the user interface (UI), including login screen, start/stop timer button, and reporting interface.
2. User Authentication (Login System)
Objectives:
Implement a user authentication mechanism to ensure only registered users can track time.
Tasks:

Frontend: Design login screen with username/email and password fields.
Backend: Set up user management using Firebase Authentication or other authentication services.
User Roles: Define two roles—Admin and User. Admins can manage users, while regular users can track time.
Authentication Flow: Upon login, users should be able to start and stop the timer, with sessions stored.
Error Handling: Display appropriate error messages for failed logins (e.g., incorrect credentials, account not found).
3. Timer Functionality
Objectives:
Enable users to track time spent working and automatically report time.
Tasks:

Frontend:
Create a button labeled "Start Work" that starts the timer when clicked.
Create a button labeled "Stop Work" that stops the timer and logs the time worked.
Display the total time worked for the current session in tenths of an hour, rounded down.
Backend:
Store start and stop times on a backend (Firebase or local storage if using GitHub Pages).
Implement session handling to calculate time in tenths of an hour and save it.
Store the calculated time in a database for future reference (daily and weekly reporting).
4. Time Reporting
Objectives:
Users should be able to view time worked on a daily and weekly basis.
Tasks:

Frontend:
Display a summary of the user’s worked hours in tenths of an hour for each day and week.
Provide a simple and clean UI to show daily and weekly reports.
Backend:
Aggregate daily and weekly worked hours based on the stored time logs.
Ensure that the data is stored in a way that supports efficient querying and retrieval.
5. Admin Panel
Objectives:
Admins can add and remove users to manage who has access to the time tracking app.
Tasks:

Frontend:
Admin dashboard with the ability to view all users, add new users, and remove users.
Display basic user information (name, email, time worked).
Backend:
Create API endpoints for adding/removing users from the database (using Firebase Functions or serverless backend).
Implement role-based access so that only Admin users can perform administrative tasks.
6. User Interface (UI) Design
Objectives:
Provide a clean, user-friendly interface.
Tasks:

Design and implement the layout for:
Login screen
Timer dashboard (start/stop buttons and timer display)
Daily/weekly report page
Admin dashboard (for user management)
Ensure responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
7. Hosting on GitHub Pages
Objectives:
Host the website on GitHub Pages with proper setup.
Tasks:

GitHub Repository Setup:

Initialize a GitHub repository for your frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Set up GitHub Pages for hosting (through the repository settings).
Ensure Static Site Compatibility:

Since GitHub Pages is a static site host, use serverless solutions for backend (e.g., Firebase Functions or API-based services).
Deployment:

Push code to GitHub repository and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
Make sure the app is properly configured for production (e.g., handling redirects, error pages, and resource loading).
8. Testing and Debugging
Objectives:
Ensure that the app works seamlessly across different scenarios.
Tasks:

Test all features (login, timer functionality, reporting, admin access).
Test on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) for responsiveness.
Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure functionality meets requirements.
Debug and fix any issues found during testing.
9. Final Deployment and Maintenance
Objectives:
Launch the app for public access.
Tasks:

Deploy the final version to GitHub Pages.
Set up monitoring for backend services (if using Firebase, monitor Firebase console for usage).
Prepare for future feature enhancements or fixes based on user feedback.
Additional Considerations:
Security: Ensure sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) is securely handled through encrypted connections (HTTPS) and authentication best practices.
Performance: Optimize the app for fast loading times, especially since it's hosted on GitHub Pages, which has limitations on dynamic server-side processing.
Scalability: As your app grows, consider how the backend can scale with increasing user base and data.
This roadmap covers the essential components for your time-tracking website app, allowing you to showcase the project and implement the required functionality step-by-step.
